**Note**
- This app is built using Commerce.js v2 SDK

## Overview

This README will guide you in getting up and running with a fully-fledged eCommerce template. We have configured this template for you to one-click deploy directly to Vercel. Alternatively, you can manually deploy to your choice of hosting platform.


## Prequisites

- IDE or code editor of your choice
- Node (v8.2.0 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Chec CLI `yarn global add @chec/cli`

## Setup

### Create a Chec account. 

Now that you‚Äôve installed Chec CLI globally, you will be able to access the list of `chec [COMMANDS]`, one of which is registering for a Chec account. Let‚Äôs go ahead and get that set up!

```bash
# Open the Chec registration page in your browser
chec register
```

Follow the rest of the walk-through to set up your merchant details. Alternatively, you can go [here](https://authorize.chec.io/signup) to register for a Chec account. 


## One-click Deploy with Vercel (recommended)

The one-click deploy allows you to add the Vercel application to your GitHub account to clone the `commercejs-nextjs-vercel` repository and deploy it automatically. Be sure to go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) and sign up for an account with Github, GitLab, or GitBucket before clicking the deploy button.

Please note that the site deploy will first fail as we have yet to enter in the environment variables for your Vercel site. Configure your site by going under the **Project Settings** in the **General** tab then scroll down to **Environment Variables** to enter your public API key. The value is automatically encrypted and stored in Vercel system. The variable name input is **CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY** and the value input is the Public Key. Please note that for the purpose of getting you up and running with a live deploy preview of the demo store, we have provided you with the public_key from our demo merchant account. Access this key [here](https://github.com/chec/commercejs-nextjs-vercel/blob/master/.env.example) and copy over the `CHEC_PUBLIC_KEY` value.
